Max Dorf is a New York based artist who is interested in combining generative and rban art through photography, videography, media and sculpture. He focuses on ideas of dichotomy to explore the ways that technology/virtual environments can exist in natural ones. He proposes ideas of entanglement and integration of both worlds. Dorf proposes that through generative artworks, we are likely to see a future whereby an ecological and technological consensus/future can be reached.
